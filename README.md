# Julia logo for LaTeX

This is a LaTeX version of the logo implemented by John Wickerson ([https://johnwickerson.github.io/]) and describe on stackexchange: [https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/113557]. It has been updated to  match official Julia colors and font ([https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/julia-logo-graphics]).

The official font is Tamil MN font, which is included (version 12.0d2e1). Note that although this font is included in macOS, macOS High Sierra has a newer version that has a slightly different shape.
